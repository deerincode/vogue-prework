    <h3 class="headThree">Welcome to my website all about me :3</h3>
        <p class="mainParas">I'm not always the best at talking about myself, but I'm happy to share! I'm 32 years old and from Lexington, South Carolina
        (born and raised). I just recently moved to Pittsburgh, PA - and I'm loving it so far! I'm transfeminine (mtf), queer as hell and
        proud of it!! If you ever have any genuine questions about trans experience, I'm happy to answer!

        <h3 class="headThree">Why Per Scholas?</h3>
        <p class="mainParas">For years now, I've been determined to start a career in software design and engineering. My initial pursuit of this goal
            was by going for a bachelors degree in computer science. Unfortunately, I found that this approach to be costly,
            too slowly paced, and did not feel like it was preparing me for a career. Dropping out from my program at the beginning of this year, 
            I began looking into low-cost/tuition free programs that would offer me the training I needed to not only secure a job in the
            world of software engineering, but to excel in it. When I disovered Per Scholas, it was immediately clear to me that it
            was an ideal program for me to apply - not only meeting what I was looking for, but exceeding it.
